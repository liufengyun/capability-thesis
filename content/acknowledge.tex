I thank Professor Martin Odersky for granting me the opportunity to
work on the master project to explore capability-based effect systems.

I thank Sandro Stucki and Nada Amin for their mentoring. Without
their help, I could not have made such a big progress from a novice in
type systems and Coq in such a short time.

Finally, I'd like to thank my wife Yinai for her long-term support and
love. A special thanks goes to my little daughter Tianyao -- playing
with her is one of the greatest joy in my spare time.
