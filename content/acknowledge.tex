\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}

I thank Professor Martin Odersky for accepting me to work on the
master project to explore capability-based effect systems, when I've
no idea what such systems should look like.

I thank Nada Amin and Sandro Stucki for their mentorship. Without
their help, I could not have made such a big progress from a novice in
type systems and Coq.

Finally, I'd like to thank my wife Yinai for her long-term support and
love. A special thanks goes to my little daughter Tianyao -- playing
with her is one of my greatest joy.
