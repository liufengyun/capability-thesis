\section{System STLC-Pure}

This chapter describes a variant of the \emph{simply typed
  lambda-calculus} with the extension of capabilities. We call this
system \emph{STLC-Pure}, because in this system all functions must
observe a variable-capturing discipline.

% In later chapters, we'll see the development of impure systems where
% there are both effect-disciplined functions which observe the
% variable-capturing discipline, and ordinary functions which don't
% observe the variable-capturing discipline.

The system STLC-Pure, though conceptually simple, can quite well
demonstrate the main features of capability-based type-and-effect
systems. We'll first introduce the formalization, then discuss
soundness and effect safety. Concepts introduced here will be a
foundation for more complex systems in later chapters.

\subsection{Definitions}

Formally, STLC-Pure is obtained by introducing a capability type and
imposing a variable capability-capturing discipline on lambda
abstractions.  Figure~\ref{fig:stlc-pure-definition} presents the full
definition of STLC-Pure.

The syntax is almost the same as standard STLC, except the addition of
capability type \emph{E} and addition of variables as values. The
evaluation rules are exactly the same, with standard call-by-value
small-step semantics. The typing rule \textsc{T-Abs} is slightly
changed by performing an operation on the environment. The
peculiarities in the formalization are explained below.

\subsubsection{Variable-Capturing Discipline}

The most important change to standard STLC lies in the following
typing rule:

\infrule[T-Abs]
{ pure(\Gamma), \; x: S \vdash t_2 : T }
{ \Gamma \vdash \lambda x:S.t_2 : S \to T }

This typing rule imposes a \emph{variable-capturing discipline} on
lambda abstractions. This discipline stipulates that only variables
whose type is not a capability type can be captured in a lambda
abstraction.

The discipline is implemented with the helper function \emph{pure},
which removes any variable bindings of the capability type \emph{E}
from the typing environment. It's easy to verify that the function
\emph{pure} satisfies following properties:

\begin{lemma}[Pure-Distributivity]
  pure (E, F) = pure E, pure F
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Pure-Idempotency]
  pure (pure E) = pure E
\end{lemma}

Initially, we've tried a variable-capturing discipline where no free
variables can be captured, i.e. $pure(\Gamma) = \varnothing$. While
this definition is certainly effect safe, the system is not very
expressive, as we lose the ability to create closures in the system,
which is usually considered to be an essential feature of functional
programming.

\subsubsection{Stoic Functions and Free Functions}

The variable-capturing discipline makes the functions in STLC-Pure
essentially different from functions in standard STLC. In STLC,
functions can capture any variables in scope, while in STLC-Pure
functions can only capture variables whose type is not a capability
type. To differentiate them (which is important as in later systems
both exist), we call the more effect-disciplined functions \emph{stoic
  functions} (or stoics) and the other \emph{free functions}.

Stoic functions are essential in capability-based effect systems. If
functions are allowed to capture capability variables in scope, it
will be impossible to tell whether a function has side effect or not
(and what kind of effect) by just checking its type. Stoic functions
are effect-disciplined in the sense that the only way for stoic
functions to have side effects is to pass a capability as parameter,
thus it can be captured by the type system.

It's important to note that stoic functions are not necessarily pure
functions. Stoic functions can have side effects, and if they do have
side effects they are honest about that in their type signature. For
example, following function \emph{hello} is a stoic function which has
IO effects\footnote{For the sake of readability, we'll use a syntax
  similar to Scala. However, we'll use $\to$ for the type of stoic
  functions, and $\Rightarrow$ for free functions.}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
  def hello(c:IO) = println("hello, world!", c)
\end{lstlisting}

In the following code snippet, we can be sure that the function
\emph{f} is pure, as it doesn't take any capability as parameter. In
the definition of \emph{f}, it's impossible to call functions to
create side effects, as in STLC-Pure all functions that can have side
effects take some capability as parameter.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
  def twice(f: Int -> Int)(x: Int) = f (f x)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Where do Effects Come From}

Careful readers might have noticed that in current effect system,
there is no formalization of effects. Indeed, that's an intentional
design choice. We assume the existence of primitive functions like
\emph{println} and \emph{readln}, which take capability parameters to
create side effects.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
  def println: String -> IO -> ()
  def readln: IO -> String
\end{lstlisting}


% As the primary concern of this study is IO effects,

\subsubsection{Where do Capabilities Come From}

In current system it is impossible to create capabilities. Where do
capabilities come from?  There are two possible answers. The first one
is that all capabilities are from the run-time and passed to the
program through the \emph{main} method.

The second one is that there are no capabilities. Capabilities can be
erased before evaluation in principle, without affecting meaning of
the program. However, in this study we only state this observation
informally and leave the formal proof to future studies.

\subsubsection{Why Treat Variables as Values}

As discussed above, in current system, there is no way to create a
value of capabilities. It means that a function taking a parameter of
the capability type can never be evaluated, as the call-by-value
semantics require the right-hand side of an application to be a
value. The same is true for the base type B -- there is no way to
create a value of type B, thus a function taking a parameter of the
base type can never be evaluated as well.

A soundness proof for such a system is not very convincing, as
substitution of a term with a value of the base type or capability
type can never happen in the system. Instead, if we treat variables as
values, functions that takes a parameter of the base type or
capability type can be evaluated with a variable of the base type or
capability type. This makes the preservation proof more convincing.

Adding variables as values doesn't break soundness or effect safety of
the system. In fact, in adding variables as values, we only added 5
lines of code in our soundness proof, and effect safety proof remains
the same.

\subsubsection{What If a Function Has More than One Side Effects}

The current system doesn't support a function to have more than one
kind of effects. For example, in the following code snippet, $c1$
can't be used in the function body, as it's removed by \emph{pure} in
the typing of the function body.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
  def error(e:Error)(c1:IO)(c2:Throw) = {
    println("error happen!", c1)
    throw c2 e
  }
\end{lstlisting}

It's straight-forward to extend the system with pairs or tuples to
overcome the limit of the current system. However, in later chapters
we'll see systems where there exists functions that are not restricted
by the variable-capturing discipline.  In those systems, this problem
is no longer an issue, thus we don't pursue the extension of pairs and
tuples here.

\subsection{Soundness}

We follow the standard formulation of soundness in TAPL
\cite{bpierce2002types}, which consists of \emph{progress} and
\emph{preservation}, defined as follows:

\begin{theorem}[Progress]
If $\varnothing \vdash t : T$, then either $t$ is a value or there is some
$t'$ with $t \longrightarrow t'$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Preservation]
If $\Gamma \vdash t : T$, and $t \longrightarrow t'$, then $\Gamma
\vdash t' : T$.
\end{theorem}

We proved both theorems in Coq based on the locally-nameless
representation. The proof of progress is the same as in STLC. However,
there is a significant difference in the proof of preservation. In the
classic proof of preservation for STLC (as shown in TAPL), it depends
on a substitution lemma, which is formulated as follows:

\begin{lemma}[Subsitution-Classic]
If $\Gamma,\; x:S \vdash t : T$, and $\Gamma \vdash s : S$, then $\Gamma
\vdash [x \mapsto s]t : T$.
\end{lemma}

However, this substitution lemma doesn't hold in current system. For a
counter-example, let's assume that $\Gamma = \{f: E \to B,\;
  c:E\}$, then it's obviously that following two propositions hold:


$\{f: E \to B,\; c:E\},\; x:B \vdash \lambda z:B.\,x \; : \; B \to
  B$ \\
$\{f: E \to B,\; c:E\},\; x:B \vdash f \; c \; : \; B$

However, following typing relationship doesn't hold if we replace
$x$ with $f \; c$.

$\{f: E \to B,\; c:E\} \vdash \lambda z:B.\,f \; c \; : \; B \to B$.

In fact, the substituted term $\lambda z:B.\,f \; c$ cannot be typed,
as according to the typing rule \textsc{T-Abs}, it cannot capture the
capability variable $c$ in the environment. To overcome this problem,
we stipulate that the term $s$ to be substituted must be a
value. Remember that in current system, both lambda abstractions and
variables are values, thus substitution of capability variables can
also happen. The new formulation is as follows:

\begin{lemma}[Subsitution-New]
  If $\Gamma,\; x:S \vdash t : T$, s is a value and
  $\Gamma \vdash s : S$, then $\Gamma \vdash [x \mapsto s]t : T$.
\end{lemma}

Interestingly, this strict evaluation requirement contrasts
capability-based effect systems with monad-based effect systems. In
Haskell, if it adopts strict evaluation, it will be impossible to
track effects in the type system, as demonstrated by following code
snippet:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
  inc n = (\x -> n + 1) (putStrLn (show n))
\end{lstlisting}

The function \emph{inc} has the type
$(Num\;a, Show\;a) \Rightarrow a \to a$. By just checking its type, we
would think it has no side effects because no IO monads appear in the
type signature. However, if Haskell adopts strict evaluation, the
function call \emph{putStrLn} will be executed, thus breaks the
monad-based effect system.

\subsection{Effect Safety}

One question that can be asked for any effect system is, does the
system really work? This question prompts us to formulate and prove
effect safety of the system. We start by formulating effect safety
informally, then put forward a formal formulation, and finally prove
effect safety of the system.

\subsubsection{Informal Formulation}

A straight-forward violation of effect safety is for pure functions to
have side effects inside the function body. Thus, a tentative
formulation would be as follows:

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety-Informally-1]
A function typed in a pure environment cannot have side effects inside.
\end{definition}

However, this formulation is obviously problematic, as we know stoic
functions can have side effects if it takes a capability
parameter. Thus, we need to restrict the functions to those not taking
capability parameters:

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety-Informally-2]
  A function (not taking any capability parameter) typed in pure
  environment cannot have side effects inside.
\end{definition}

This formulation looks more satisfactory, but it's a little
cumbersome. Let's transform it into a more succinct statement. If we
inspect the \textsc{T-Abs} typing rule closely, we can find that if
\emph{S} is not a capability type, $pure(\Gamma),\; x: S$ is equal to
$pure(\Gamma,\; x: S)$.

\infrule[T-Abs]
{ pure(\Gamma),\; x: S \vdash t_2 : T }
{ \Gamma \vdash \lambda x:S.\;t_2 : S \to T }

Thus, instead of saying a function $\lambda x:S.t_2 : S$ cannot have
side effects inside, we can say the term $t_2$ cannot have side
effects in pure environment. As we know, to have side effects, we must
supply a capability as parameter. Thus, the term $t_2$ cannot have
side effects if we cannot construct a term of capability type in a
pure environment. This observation leads us to the following statement
of effect safety:

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety-Informally-3]
  It's impossible to construct a term $t$ of capability type in a pure
  environment.
\end{definition}

This formulation looks very promising, but in fact it cannot be proved!
For a counter-example, let's assume $\Gamma = \{f: B \to E, \; x:
B\}$. It's obvious that $\Gamma$ is pure, but we can construct the
term $f \; x$ which is of the capability type.

The cause of the problem is that in a pure environment, there could
exist non-inhabitable types like $B \to E$.  Existence of
non-inhabitable types in pure environment doesn't pose a problem to
the system, because if a function takes a parameter of a
non-inhabitable type, the function can never be actually called.

To convince the readers that the current system is effect-safe, we
need to exclude and only exclude non-inhabitable types from the pure
environment and then prove that it is impossible to construct a term
of capability type in this restricted environment. Thus we arrive at
following formulation:

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety-Informally-4]
  It's impossible to construct a term $t$ of capability type in any
  pure environment with only variables of inhabitable types.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Inhabitability}

We need to define the concept \emph{inhabitability} precisely. What
types are inhabitable? An inhabitable type should be able to be
inhabited by a term using the typing rules. Obviously, given a typing
relation $\Gamma \vdash t: T$, we cannot immediately conclude that T
is inhabitable -- we need to ensure that $\Gamma$ only contains
inhabitable types. Otherwise, any type is inhabitable if $\Gamma$
contains a variable of the corresponding type.

One thing we are sure about is that, if $\Gamma$ is empty, then $T$ is
inhabitable. If $\Gamma$ if not empty, and the binding
$x:S \in \Gamma$ and S is inhabitable, then we can remove x:S from
$\Gamma$ and substitute x in the term t with the term that inhabits
the type S to obtain a new term $t'$. The substitution lemma tells us
that the new term $t'$ still has the type T. Continue this line of
thought, we'll find out that all inhabitable types can be inhabited in
the empty environment. Thus, a tentative definition is as follows:

\begin{definition}[Inhabitability-First-Try]
  A type T is inhabitable if there exists a term t with $\varnothing
  \vdash t : T$.
\end{definition}

However, this definition is not satisfactory in our case, as in system
STLC-Pure there doesn't exist values for the base type and capability
type except variables, though we do want both types to be
inhabitable. A natural approach is to extend the empty environment
with two variables of the base type and capability type respectively:

\begin{definition}[Inhabitability-Second-Try]
  A type T is inhabitable if there exists a term t with
  $x:B,\; y:E \vdash t : T$.
\end{definition}

This definition indeed gives us all inhabitable types in system
STLC-Pure. However, we can do better with following definition:

\begin{definition}[Inhabitability-Final]
  A type T is inhabitable if there exists a value v with the typing
  $x:B,\; y:E \vdash v : T$.
\end{definition}

What if the term $t$ in the second definition is an application? In
that case, $t$ must be able to take a step until it becomes a
value. And the preservation theorem tells us the type remains
unchanged during evaluation. This final definition makes proofs
related to inhabitability simpler. It's useful to give a definition of
inhabitable environments as well:

\begin{definition}[Inhabitable-Environment]
  An environment $\Gamma$ is inhabitable if it only contains variables
  of inhabitable types.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Formalization}

With the formal definition of inhabitability, we can easily formalize
the informal statement of effect safety as follows:

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety-Inhabitability]
  If $\Gamma$ is a pure and inhabitable environment, then there
  doesn't exist $t$ with $\Gamma \vdash t : E$.
\end{definition}

However, this formulation doesn't give rise to a direct proof. In
fact, this statement is too strong -- some non-inhabitable types, such
as $E \to B \to E$, don't enable us to create a term of the type $E$,
thus it's safe to be kept in the environment. This means it's possible
to impose a looser restriction on $\Gamma$, as long as all inhabitable
types that can appear in a pure and inhabitable environment can also
appear in $\Gamma$.

When we examine the problem more closely, we found that through the
lens of \emph{Curry Howard Isomorphism}, effect safety actually says
that it is impossible to prove the capability type $E$ from a group of
``good'' premises. Thus, we can classify all types (propositions) into
two groups: in one group $E$ cannot be proved and in the other group
$E$ can be proved. This leads us to a formulation of \emph{healthy
  environment}\footnote{Sandro Stucki suggested the idea of using
  \emph{caprod} for the definition of \emph{pure} environments. I
  developed it to be a formulation of \emph{healthy} environments and
  used it in proving effect safety.} given in
Figure~\ref{fig:stlc-pure-healthy-definition}.

\caption{System STLC-Pure Healthy Environment}
\label{fig:stlc-pure-healthy-definition}
\end{figure}

In the definition, types like $B \to B$, $E \to E$, $E \to B$ and
$(B \to E) \to B$ are considered as \emph{capsafe}, while types like
$B \to E$, $(E \to B) \to E$ are considered as \emph{caprod}. Only
\emph{capsafe} types can appear in a \emph{healthy} environment. To
inspect the formalization in detail, we can ask several questions.

\emph{Are capsafe types inhabitable?} The answer is no. The type
$E \to B \to E$ is non-inhabitable. However, allowing this type in the
healthy environment doesn't enable us to construct a term of the
capability type E.

\emph{Are inhabitable types capsafe?} The answer is yes, except the
capability type $E$. As the capability type $E$ can't appear in the
pure environment, this is not a problem.

\emph{Are caprod types non-inhabitable?} Yes, except the capability
type $E$. As $E$ is also excluded in the pure environment, thus it's
justified to remove it from the healthy environment.

Intuitively, the rule \textsc{CP-Fun} can be justified by the fact
that in a healthy environment it is impossible to construct a function
which takes a \emph{capsafe} parameter and returns a value of
\emph{caprod} type. Or from a logical point of view, given a proof
from which E can't be proved, we can't transform it to be a proof
capable of proving E, together with a group of premises incapable of
proving E.

\emph{Why this formulation of healthy environment is acceptable?} This
formulation is acceptable because a pure and inhabitable environment
is also a healthy environment. This claim has been formally proved:

\begin{lemma}[Inhabitable-Capsafe]
  If the type T is inhabitable, then either T is capsafe or $T = E$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Inhabitable-Pure-Healthy]
  If $\Gamma$ is pure and inhabitable, then $\Gamma$ is also healthy.
\end{theorem}

From the theorem above, it's obvious that any property proved for a
healthy environment also holds for a pure and inhabitable
environment. Therefore, effect safety can be reformulated more
generally as follows:

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety]
  If $\Gamma$ is healthy, then there doesn't exist $t$ with
  $\Gamma \vdash t : E$.
\end{definition}

The statement \emph{Effect-Safety} logically implies the statement
\emph{Effect-Safety-Inhabitability}. Thus, it suffices to prove the
statement \emph{Effect-Safety}.

\subsubsection{Proof}

The proof of effect safety depends on following lemmas, most of them
are straight-forward to prove. Effect safety follows immediately from
the lemma \emph{Healthy-Capsafe}.


\begin{lemma}[Capsafe-Not-Caprod]
 If type T is capsafe, then T is not caprod.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Capsafe-Or-Caprod]
 For any T, T is either capsafe or caprod.
\end{lemma}

% \begin{lemma}[Healthy-Pure]
%   If environment $\Gamma$ is healthy, then $pure \; \Gamma = \Gamma$.
% \end{lemma}

% Following generalized lemma is essential in the proof of effect safety:

\begin{lemma}[Healthy-Capsafe]
  If $\Gamma$ is healthy and $\Gamma \vdash t : T$, then T is capsafe.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Effect-Safety]
  If $\Gamma$ is healhty, then there doesn't exist $t$ with
  $\Gamma \vdash t : E$.
\end{theorem}
