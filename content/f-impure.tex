\section{System F-Impure}

In this chapter, we present the system \emph{F-Impure}, which is an
extension of the system F-Pure with free functions. It can also be
seen as an extension of the system STLC-Impure with universal types,
but without subtyping. Extending the system with subtyping would lead
us to bounded polymorphism, which we are still working on. Given the
importance of parametric polymorphism and the fact that subtyping is
not a necessary addon of functional programming, the system
\emph{F-Impure} deserves a separate presentation here.

We'll first introduce the formalization, then discuss soundness and
effect safety. In the discussion, we'll focus on its difference from
the system STLC-Impure and F-Pure.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Definitions}

Figure~\ref{fig:f-impure-definition} presents the full definition of
F-Pure, with the difference from the system F-Impure highlighted. As
can be seen from the figure, we introduced free function types and
added a typing rule for free functions. As we have no subtyping in the
system, we have to add a \textsc{T-Degen} rule to restore the
subtyping relationship between stoic function types and free function
types.

As in STLC-Impure, we also adapted the definition of \emph{pure} to
exclude free function types from pure environments. If we allow stoic
functions to have access to free functions, we'll loose the ability to
track the effects of stoic functions in the type system.

A different design choice we could make is to introduce free universal
abstractions in the system. From the viewpoint of practicality, such a
type will not be very useful in real-world programming, as in practice
polymorphic functions rarely capture free variables, not mention
capability variables. Thus for the sake of simplicity, we don't pursue
the extension here.

\subsection{Soundness}

We proved both progress and preservation in Coq based on the
locally-nameless representation. The subtleties in the proof are the
same as stated in system F-Pure, thus we don't reiterate there.

\begin{theorem}[Progress]
If $\varnothing \vdash t : T$, then either $t$ is a value or there is some
$t'$ with $t \longrightarrow t'$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Preservation]
If $\Gamma \vdash t : T$, and $t \longrightarrow t'$, then $\Gamma
\vdash t' : T$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Effect Safety}

We'll first introduce the formulation, which is a combination of the
formualtion in STLC-Impure and F-Pure, then discuss the proof of
effect safety.

\subsubsection{Formulation}

As in the system STLC-Impure, in the presence of free functions, we'll
need two statements of effect safety:

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety-Inhabitability-1]
  If $\Gamma$ is a pure and inhabitable environment, then there
  doesn't exist $t$ with $\Gamma \vdash t : E$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety-Inhabitability-2]
  If $\Gamma$ is a pure and inhabitable environment, and
  $\Gamma \vdash t_1 \; t_2 : T$, then there exists U, V such that
  $\Gamma \vdash t_1 : U \to V$.
\end{definition}


As in the system STLC-Pure, the proof of these two statements depends
on a weaker and more general statement about \emph{healthy
  environments}. Given that we've seen how universal types and free
function types are extended in the formulation of \emph{healthy
  environment}, we can easily combine them to arrive at the
formulation shown in Figure~\ref{fig:f-impure-healthy-definition},
with the changes from F-Pure highlighted.

\caption{System F-Impure Healthy Environment}
\label{fig:f-impure-healthy-definition}
\end{figure}

\emph{Why this formulation of healthy environment is acceptable?} We
need to ensure that a pure and inhabitable environment is also a
healthy environment. This claim has been formally proved:

\begin{lemma}[Inhabitable-Capsafe]
  If the type T is inhabitable, then either T is capsafe or $T = E$ or
  T is a free function type.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Inhabitable-Pure-Healthy]
  If $\Gamma$ is pure and inhabitable, then $\Gamma$ is also healthy.
\end{theorem}

From the theorem above, it's obvious that any property proved for a
healthy environment also holds for a pure and inhabitable
environment. Thus, it suffices to prove the following statements about
healthy environments.

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety-1]
  If $\Gamma$ is healthy, there doesn't exist $t$ with
  $\Gamma \vdash t : E$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Effect-Safety-2]
  If $\Gamma$ is pure and healthy, and $\Gamma \vdash t_1 \; t_2 : T$,
  then there exists U, V such that $\Gamma \vdash t_1 : U \to V$.
\end{definition}

Note that in the second statement of effect safety, we also impose
that $\Gamma$ is pure. This is exactly the same case as we've seen in
the system STLC-Impure. The justification is that the statement
\emph{Effect-Safety-1} and \emph{Effect-Safety-2} logically imply the
statement \emph{Effect-Safety-Inhabitability-1} and
\emph{Effect-Safety-Inhabitability-2} respectively, thus it suffices
to prove the statement \emph{Effect-Safety-1} and
\emph{Effect-Safety-2}.

\subsubsection{Proof}

The proof of the first effect safety statement is nearly the same as
in the system F-Pure, thus we don't reiterate here.

When we come the the proof of the second statement of effect safety,
we encounter the same problem as in system STLC-Impure. We need to
assume a set of axioms, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:f-impure-definition}. We highlighted the new added
axioms to the axioms in STLC-Impure. The justification for the axioms
\textsc{Ax-All} and \textsc{Ax-Var} is the same as the justification
for the axiom \textsc{Ax-Base}, which we've seen in the system
STLC-Impure. In short, because the outer function is stoic and the
parameter is pure, the inner function can actually capture no
capabilities or free functions, thus it's fair enough to type the
inner function as stoic as well.

{ \Gamma \vdash t : (U \to V) \to S \Rightarrow T }
{ \Gamma \vdash t : (U \to V) \to S \to T }

\end{multicols}
\end{framed}

\caption{System F-Impure Axioms}
\label{fig:f-impure-axioms}
\end{figure}

The justification for the axiom \textsc{Ax-TApp} is similar. If a term
$t$ can be typed as $\forall X.T_1 \Rightarrow T_2$ under $\Gamma$,
according to the typing rule \textsc{T-All}, the whole term can be
typed under $pure(\Gamma)$. Then the inner lambda abstraction can be
typed under $pure(\Gamma), X$, which is equal to $pure(\Gamma,
X)$. Thus, it's fair enough to type the inner function as stoic.

The justification for the axiom \textsc{Ax-Poly} is the same as given
in STLC-Impure, thus we don't reiterate here.

Assuming the axioms, it's straight-forward to prove a lemma
\emph{Healthy-Pure-Stoic}, and the second statement of effect safety
follows immediately from the lemma.

\begin{lemma}[Healthy-Pure-Stoic]
  If $\Gamma$ is pure and healthy,  and $\Gamma \vdash t : S
  \Rightarrow T$, then $\Gamma \vdash t : S \to T$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Effect-Safety-2']
  If $\Gamma$ is pure and healthy, and $\Gamma \vdash t_1 \; t_2 : T$,
  then there exists U, V such that $\Gamma \vdash t_1 : U \to V$.
\end{theorem}
