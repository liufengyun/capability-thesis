The problem of \emph{effect polymorphism} is the main obstacle to the
wide adoption of effect systems in the programming community. The
absence of effect systems reduces compiler optimization opportunities
and disables programmers from imposing effect constraints on APIs in
parallel and distributed computations.

This study shows that \emph{capability-based} effect systems, equipped
with \emph{stoic functions} and \emph{free functions}, can easily
solve the problem of \emph{effect polymorphism} without incurring
notational burden on programmers. This advantage makes
capability-based effect systems stand a better chance to be adopted by
the programming community.
