The problem of \emph{Effect polymorphism} is the main obstacle to the
wide adoption of effect systems. The absence of effect systems reduces
compiler optimization opportunities of pure functions and decreases
design flexibility of imposing effect constraints on the API in
parallel and distributed computations.


We show that \emph{capability-based} effect systems, when equipped
with \emph{stoic functions} and \emph{free functions}, can easily
solve the problem of \emph{effect polymorphism} without incurring any
notational burden. This advantage makes capability-based effect
systems stand a better chance to be adopted by the programming
community.
