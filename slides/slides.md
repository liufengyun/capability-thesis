# Introduction

## Motivation: An Effect System for Scala

```Scala
def pmap(xs: List[Int], f: Int => Int): List[Int]
```

## Intuition: Capabilities

Hello, world!

## Stoic Functions

- Stoic functions are not necessary pure, can have side effects
- Effect disciplined, honest about effects in their type signature

## Comparison

- Monads can't handle effect polymorphism, duplication of code
- Monads difficult to understand and use, capability more accessible
